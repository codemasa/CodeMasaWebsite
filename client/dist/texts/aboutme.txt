I am a very enthusiastic learner who strives every day to become a better version of myself. I worked shortly for an NSF research project as a coding specialist. Currently, I am looking for a Software Engineer/Developer role in order to expand my network and step foot into the tech industry with great ambition and enthusiasm.

Outside of my passion for software, I like to diversify my interests. From music to writing, from playing video games to learning new languages, I often have trouble finding time for everything I am interested in, but I somehow manage. The beauty of that, in my opinion, is that my life is never stale. I am able to indulge in many things in which I find joy.
